# Project Setup Guide

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed on your system. If not, download and install it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

## Steps to Run the Code

### 1. Create a Groq API Key
- Sign up or log in to [Groq](https://groq.com/) to obtain your API key.
- Store the API key in a `.env` file with the following format:
  ```
  groq_api=your_groq_api_key_here
  ```

### 2. Install Dependencies
- Install the required packages using:
  ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

### 3. Run the Application
- Execute the following command to start the application:
  ```
  python gradio.py
  ```

This will launch the application using Gradio, and you can interact with it through your web browser.

## Additional Notes
- Ensure your `.env` file is in the same directory as `gradio.py`.
- If you encounter any issues, check if all dependencies are installed correctly.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
